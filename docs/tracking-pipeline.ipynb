    "1. Create a directory with the name of your dataset in: ``data/``\n",
    "2. Store the images in: ``data/<dataset_name>/images/raw/``\n",
    "   - Tip: To avoid processing specific/irrelevant areas of the images, create a masking image with blacked out areas and store it in: ``data/<dataset_name>/images/mask.<image_format>``\n",
    "3. Create a ground truth dataset with annotated detections that follows the MOT format and store the file in: ``data/<dataset_name>/annotations/gt.txt``\n",
